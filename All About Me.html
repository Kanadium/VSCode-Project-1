    <h2>Matt</h2>
    <p>It's a pleasure to meet you all and I can't wait to see how our journey together will be! 
        When I'm not working on homework then I am working on some crazy project!</p>
    <p>After I graduate I plan on attempting to get a job with Verizon. 
        My first degree was in PT (Physical Therapy) in which I learned quite a lot about the human body. 
        I originally wanted to learn it because I had some friends who were going that same direction with career paths but after 3 semesters i figured that it wasn't for me.</p>
    <p>I have been trying to learn programming ( mainly C++ , C, and Python through a game called TwilioQuest  ) 
        on my own but I thought it was about time to take classes to properly learn how to code and program!</p>
